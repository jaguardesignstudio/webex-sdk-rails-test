# Webex Rails SDK Test

This is a vanilla Rails 6.1 project, with the `webex` package from npm added, and
the initialization code from the documentation added to the default Rails JS file.

The following error (seen in the Chrome console) is what we have experienced when
attempting to add this library to existing Rails + React projects.

![strtok3 error](/public/strtok3-error.jpg?raw=true "strtok3 error, webex package dependency")

We created this vanilla project to demonstrate the issue and ensure it was not
caused by any other libraries or custom code in our projects.
